## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Robinhood - I like the simplicity of it, I like being able to see the total amount of value my stocks have and what movements where made in the market upon opening the app.

Tiktok - I like how they innovated social media completely with their signature for you page where you can swipe up endlessly.

TCGplayer - I like to collect cards myself so I like being able to look up my card prices and new releases on this app.

I would like to create an app that's a mix of both Robinhood and TCGplayer where I can create a profile, add my cards into my inventory and from there just be able to watch the movement of my card prices over time.'

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was challenging having to connect the github with xcode since i've never done that before and understanding the swift syntax.'
